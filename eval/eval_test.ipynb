A common issue is\\nthe generation of\\ninformation, or ”hallucina-\\ntions” [Zhang et al., 2023b], especially when queries extend\\nbeyond the model’s training data or necessitate up-to-date in-\\nformation. These shortcomings underscore the impractical-\\nity of deploying LLMs as black-box solutions in real-world\\nproduction environments without additional safeguards. One\\npromising approach to mitigate these limitations is Retrieval-\\nAugmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external\\ndata retrieval into the generative process, thereby enhancing\\nthe model’s ability to provide accurate and relevant responses.\\nRAG, introduced by Lewis et al. [Lewis et al., 2020] in\\nmid-2020, stands as a paradigm within the realm of LLMs,\\nenhancing generative tasks. Specifically, RAG involves an\\ninitial retrieval step where the LLMs query an external data\\nsource to obtain relevant information before proceeding to an-\\nswer questions or generate text. This process not only informs\\nthe subsequent generation phase but also ensures that the re-\\nsponses are grounded in retrieved evidence, thereby signif-\\nicantly enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the output.\\nThe dynamic retrieval of information from knowledge bases\\nduring the inference phase allows RAG to address issues such\\nas the generation of factually incorrect content, commonly\\nreferred to as “hallucinations.” The integration of RAG into\\nLLMs has seen rapid adoption and has become a pivotal tech-\\nnology in refining the capabilities of chatbots and rendering\\nLLMs more viable for practical applications.\\n\\nThe evolutionary trajectory of RAG unfolds across four\\ndistinctive phases, as illustrated in Figure 1.\\nIn its in-\\nception in 2017, aligned with the emergence of the Trans-\\nformer architecture, the primary thrust was on assimilating\\nadditional knowledge through Pre-Training Models (PTM)\\nto augment language models. This epoch witnessed RAG’s\\nfoundational efforts predominantly directed at optimizing\\npre-training methodologies.\\n\\nFollowing this initial phase, a period of relative dormancy\\nensued before the advent of chatGPT, during which there was\\nminimal advancement in related research for RAG.

In this\\nscenario, a user inquires ChatGPT about a recent high-profile\\nevent (i.e., the abrupt dismissal and reinstatement of Ope-\\nnAI’s CEO) which generated considerable public discourse.\\nChatGPT as the most renowned and widely utilized LLM,\\nconstrained by its pretraining data, lacks knowledge of re-\\ncent events. RAG addresses this gap by retrieving up-to-date\\ndocument excerpts from external knowledge bases. In this in-\\nstance, it procures a selection of news articles pertinent to the\\ninquiry. These articles, alongside the initial question, are then\\namalgamated into an enriched prompt that enables ChatGPT\\nto synthesize an informed response. This example illustrates\\nthe RAG process, demonstrating its capability to enhance the\\nmodel’s responses with real-time information retrieval.\\n\\nTechnologically, RAG has been enriched through various\\ninnovative approaches addressing pivotal questions such as\\n“what to retrieve” “when to retrieve” and “how to use the\\nretrieved information”. For “what to retrieve” research has\\nprogressed from simple token [Khandelwal et al., 2019] and\\nentity retrieval [Nishikawa et al., 2022] to more complex\\nstructures like chunks [Ram et al., 2023] and knowledge\\ngraph [Kang et al., 2023], with studies focusing on the\\nretrieval and the level of data structur-\\ngranularity of\\ning.\\nCoarse granularity brings more information but\\nwith lower precision. Retrieving structured text provides\\nmore information while sacrificing efficiency. The ques-\\ntion of “when to retrieve” has led to strategies ranging\\nfrom single [Wang et al., 2023e, Shi et al., 2023] to adap-\\ntive [Jiang et al., 2023b, Huang et al., 2023] and multiple\\nretrieval [Izacard et al., 2022] methods. High frequency of\\nretrieval brings more information and lower efficiency. As\\nfor ”how to use” the retrieved data, integration techniques\\nhave been developed across various levels of the model\\n[Khattab et al., 2022],\\narchitecture,\\nintermediate\\nlay-\\ners [Liang et al., 2023]. Although the “intermediate” and\\n“output layers” are more effective, there are problems with\\nthe need for training and low efficiency.\\n\\nincluding the input\\n[Borgeaud et al., 2022],\\n\\noutput\\n\\nand\\n\\nRAG is a paradigm that enhances LLMs by integrating ex-\\nternal knowledge bases. It employs a synergistic approach,\\ncombining information retrieval mechanisms and In-Context\\nLearning (ICL) to bolster the LLM’s performance.\\nIn this\\nframework, a query initiated by a user prompts the retrieval of\\n\\npertinent information via search algorithms. This information\\nis then woven into the LLM’s prompts, providing additional\\ncontext for the generation process. RAG’s key advantage lies\\nin its obviation of the need for retraining of LLMs for task-\\nspecific applications. Developers can instead append an ex-\\nternal knowledge repository, enriching the input and thereby\\nrefining the model’s output precision. RAG has become one\\nof the most popular architectures in LLMs’ systems, due to\\nits high practicality and low barrier to entry, with many con-\\nversational products being built almost entirely on RAG.\\n\\nThe RAG workflow comprises three key steps. First, the\\ncorpus is partitioned into discrete chunks, upon which vec-\\ntor indices are constructed utilizing an encoder model. Sec-\\nond, RAG identifies and retrieves chunks based on their vec-\\ntor similarity to the query and indexed chunks. Finally, the\\nmodel synthesizes a response conditioned on the contextual\\ninformation gleaned from the retrieved chunks. These steps\\nform the fundamental framework of the RAG process, under-\\npinning its information retrieval and context-aware genera-\\ntion capabilities. Next, we will provide an introduction to the\\nRAG research framework.\\n\\n3 RAG Framework\\nThe RAG research paradigm is continuously evolving, and\\nthis section primarily delineates its progression. We cate-\\ngorize it into three types: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and\\nModular RAG. While RAG were cost-effective and surpassed\\nthe performance of the native LLM, they also exhibited sev-\\neral limitations. The development of Advanced RAG and\\nModular RAG was a response to these specific shortcomings\\nin Naive RAG.\\n\\n3.1 Naive RAG\\nThe Naive RAG research paradigm represents the earliest\\nmethodology, which gained prominence shortly after the\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows a\\ntraditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and gen-\\neration. It is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read” frame-\\nwork [Ma et al., 2023a].\\n\\nIndexing\\nThe indexing process is a crucial initial step in data prepara-\\ntion that occurs offline and involves several stages. It begins\\nwith data indexing, where original data is cleansed and ex-\\ntracted, and various file formats such as PDF, HTML, Word,\\nand Markdown are converted into standardized plain text. In\\norder to fit within the context limitations of language models,\\nthis text is then segmented into smaller, more manageable\\nchunks in a process known as chunking. These chunks are\\nsubsequently transformed into vector representations through\\nan embedding model, chosen for its balance between infer-\\nence efficiency and model size. This facilitates similarity\\ncomparisons during the retrieval phase. Finally, an index is\\ncreated to store these text chunks and their vector embed-\\ndings as key-value pairs, which allows for efficient and scal-\\nable search capabilities.\\n\\nRetrieval\\nUpon receipt of a user query, the system employs the same en-\\ncoding model utilized during the indexing phase to transcode\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '2'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 2: A representative instance of the RAG process applied to question answering\\n\\nthe input into a vector representation.\\nIt then proceeds to\\ncompute the similarity scores between the query vector and\\nthe vectorized chunks within the indexed corpus. The system\\nprioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that demonstrate\\nthe greatest similarity to the query. These chunks are subse-\\nquently used as the expanded contextual basis for addressing\\nthe user’s request.\\n\\nGeneration\\nThe posed query and selected documents are synthesized into\\na coherent prompt to which a large language model is tasked\\nwith formulating a response. The model’s approach to an-\\nswering may vary depending on task-specific criteria, allow-\\ning it to either draw upon its inherent parametric knowledge\\nor restrict its responses to the information contained within\\nthe provided documents.\\nIn cases of ongoing dialogues,\\nany existing conversational history can be integrated into the\\nprompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn dialogue\\ninteractions effectively.\\n\\nDrawbacks in Naive RAG\\nNaive RAG faces significant challenges in three key areas:\\n“Retrieval,” “Generation,” and “Augmentation”.\\n\\nRetrieval quality poses diverse challenges, including low\\nprecision, leading to misaligned retrieved chunks and po-\\ntential issues like hallucination or mid-air drop. Low recall\\nalso occurs, resulting in the failure to retrieve all relevant\\nchunks, thereby hindering the LLMs’ ability to craft compre-\\n\\nhensive responses. Outdated information further compounds\\nthe problem, potentially yielding inaccurate retrieval results.\\nResponse generation quality presents hallucination chal-\\nlenge, where the model generates answers not grounded in\\nthe provided context, as well as issues of irrelevant context\\nand potential toxicity or bias in the model’s output.\\n\\nThe augmentation process presents its own challenges in\\neffectively integrating context from retrieved passages with\\nthe current generation task, potentially leading to disjointed\\nor incoherent output. Redundancy and repetition are also\\nconcerns, especially when multiple retrieved passages con-\\ntain similar information, resulting in repetitive content in the\\ngenerated response.\\n\\nDiscerning the importance and relevance of multiple re-\\ntrieved passages to the generation task is another challenge,\\nrequiring the proper balance of each passage’s value. Addi-\\ntionally, reconciling differences in writing styles and tones to\\nensure consistency in the output is crucial.\\n\\nLastly, there’s a risk of generation models overly depend-\\ning on augmented information, potentially resulting in out-\\nputs that merely reiterate the retrieved content without pro-\\nviding new value or synthesized information.\\n\\n3.2 Advanced RAG\\nAdvanced RAG has been developed with targeted enhance-\\nments to address the shortcomings of Naive RAG. In terms\\nof retrieval quality, Advanced RAG implements pre-retrieval\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '3'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='and post-retrieval strategies. To address the indexing chal-\\nlenges experienced by Naive RAG, Advanced RAG has re-\\nfined its indexing approach using techniques such as slid-\\ning window, fine-grained segmentation, and metadata. It has\\nalso introduced various methods to optimize the retrieval pro-\\ncess [ILIN, 2023].\\n\\nPre-Retrieval Process\\nOptimizing Data Indexing.The goal of optimizing data index-\\ning is to enhance the quality of the content being indexed.\\nThis involves five primary strategies: enhancing data gran-\\nularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata, align-\\nment optimization, and mixed retrieval.\\n\\nEnhancing data granularity aims to elevate text standard-\\nization, consistency, factual accuracy, and rich context to im-\\nprove the RAG system’s performance. This includes remov-\\ning irrelevant information, dispelling ambiguity in entities\\nand terms, confirming factual accuracy, maintaining context,\\nand updating outdated documents.\\n\\nOptimizing index structures involves adjusting the size of\\nchunks to capture relevant context, querying across multiple\\nindex paths, and incorporating information from the graph\\nstructure to capture relevant context by leveraging relation-\\nships between nodes in a graph data index.\\n\\nAdding metadata information involves integrating refer-\\nenced metadata, such as dates and purposes, into chunks for\\nfiltering purposes, and incorporating metadata like chapters\\nand subsections of references to improve retrieval efficiency.\\nAlignment optimization addresses alignment issues and\\ndisparities between documents by introducing “hypothetical\\nquestions” [Li et al., 2023d] into documents to rectify align-\\nment issues and differences.\\n\\nRetrieval\\nDuring the retrieval stage, the primary focus is on identifying\\nthe appropriate context by calculating the similarity between\\nthe query and chunks. The embedding model is central to\\nthis process. In the advanced RAG, there is potential for op-\\ntimization of the embedding models.\\n\\nFine-tuning Embedding. Fine-tuning embedding models\\nsignificantly impact the relevance of retrieved content in RAG\\nsystems. This process involves customizing embedding mod-\\nels to enhance retrieval relevance in domain-specific contexts,\\nespecially for professional domains dealing with evolving or\\nrare terms. The BGE embedding model [BAAI, 2023], such\\nas BGE-large-EN developed by BAAI2, is an example of a\\nhigh-performance embedding model that can be fine-tuned\\nto optimize retrieval relevance. Training data for fine-tuning\\ncan be generated using language models like GPT-3.5-turbo\\nto formulate questions grounded on document chunks, which\\nare then used as fine-tuning pairs.\\n\\nDynamic Embedding adapts to the context in which words\\nare used, unlike static embedding, which uses a single vec-\\ntor for each word [Karpukhin et al., 2020]. For example,\\nin transformer models like BERT, the same word can have\\nvaried embeddings depending on surrounding words. Ope-\\nnAI’s embeddings-ada-02 model3, built upon the principles\\n\\n2https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en\\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\\n\\nof LLMs like GPT, is a sophisticated dynamic embedding\\nmodel that captures contextual understanding. However, it\\nmay not exhibit the same sensitivity to context as the latest\\nfull-size language models like GPT-4.\\n\\nPost-Retrieval Process\\nAfter retrieving valuable context from the database, it is es-\\nsential to merge it with the query as an input into LLMs while\\naddressing challenges posed by context window limits. Sim-\\nply presenting all relevant documents to the LLM at once may\\nexceed the context window limit, introduce noise, and hinder\\nthe focus on crucial information. Additional processing of the\\nretrieved content is necessary to address these issues.\\n\\nRe-Ranking. Re-ranking the retrieved information to re-\\nlocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt\\nis a key strategy.\\nThis concept has been implemented\\nin frameworks such as LlamaIndex4, LangChain5, and\\nHayStack [Blagojevi, 2023]. For example, Diversity Ranker6\\nprioritizes reordering based on document diversity, while\\nLostInTheMiddleRanker alternates placing the best docu-\\nment at the beginning and end of the context window. Ad-\\nditionally, approaches like cohereAI rerank [Cohere, 2023],\\nbge-rerank7, and LongLLMLingua [Jiang et al., 2023a] re-\\ncalculate the semantic similarity between relevant text and the\\nquery, addressing the challenge of interpreting vector-based\\nsimulated searches for semantic similarity.\\n\\nPrompt Compression. Research indicates that noise in re-\\ntrieved documents adversely affects RAG performance.\\nIn\\npost-processing, the emphasis lies in compressing irrelevant\\ncontext, highlighting pivotal paragraphs, and reducing the\\noverall context length. Approaches such as Selective Context\\nand LLMLingua [Litman et al., 2020, Anderson et al., 2022]\\nutilize small\\nlanguage models to calculate prompt mu-\\ntual information or perplexity, estimating element impor-\\ntance. Recomp [Xu et al., 2023a] addresses this by train-\\ning compressors at different granularities, while Long\\nContext [Xu et al., 2023b] and “Walking in the Memory\\nMaze” [Chen et al., 2023a] design summarization techniques\\nto enhance LLM’s key information perception, particularly in\\ndealing with extensive contexts.\\n\\n3.3 Modular RAG\\nThe modular RAG structure diverges from the tradi-\\ntional Naive RAG framework, providing greater versatil-\\nity and flexibility.\\nIt integrates various methods to en-\\nhance functional modules, such as incorporating a search\\nmodule for similarity retrieval and applying a fine-tuning\\napproach in the retriever [Lin et al., 2023]. Restructured\\nRAG modules [Yu et al., 2022] and iterative methodologies\\nlike [Shao et al., 2023] have been developed to address spe-\\ncific issues. The modular RAG paradigm is increasingly be-\\ncoming the norm in the RAG domain, allowing for either a\\nserialized pipeline or an end-to-end training approach across\\nmultiple modules. The comparison of three RAG paradigms\\n\\n4https://www.llamaindex.ai\\n5https://www.langchain.com/\\n6https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/\\nenhancing-rag-pipelines-in-haystack\\n\\n7https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-large\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '4'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 3: Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG\\n\\nis depicted in Figure 3. However, Modular RAG is not stan-\\ndalone. Advanced RAG is a specialized form of modular\\nRAG, and further, Naive RAG itself is a special case of Ad-\\nvanced RAG. The relationship among the three paradigms is\\none of inheritance and development.\\n\\nNew Modules\\nSearch Module.\\nIn contrast to the similarity retrieval in\\nNaive/Advanced RAG, the Search Module is tailored to spe-\\ncific scenarios and incorporates direct searches on additional\\ncorpora. This integration is achieved using code generated\\nby the LLM, query languages such as SQL or Cypher, and\\nother custom tools. The data sources for these searches can\\ninclude search engines, text data, tabular data, and knowledge\\ngraphs [Wang et al., 2023d].\\n\\nMemory Module. This module harnesses the memory ca-\\npabilities of the LLM to guide retrieval. The approach in-\\nvolves identifying memories most similar to the current input.\\nSelfmem [Cheng et al., 2023b] utilizes a retrieval-enhanced\\ngenerator to create an unbounded memory pool iteratively,\\ncombining the “original question” and “dual question”. By\\nemploying a retrieval-enhanced generative model that uses its\\nown outputs to improve itself, the text becomes more aligned\\nwith the data distribution during the reasoning process. Con-\\nsequently, the model’s own outputs are utilized instead of the\\ntraining data [Wang et al., 2022a].\\n\\nFusion. RAG-Fusion [Raudaschl, 2023]enhances tradi-\\ntional search systems by addressing their limitations through\\na multi-query approach that expands user queries into mul-\\n\\ntiple, diverse perspectives using an LLM. This approach not\\nonly captures the explicit information users seek but also un-\\ncovers deeper, transformative knowledge. The fusion pro-\\ncess involves parallel vector searches of both original and\\nexpanded queries, intelligent re-ranking to optimize results,\\nand pairing the best outcomes with new queries. This sophis-\\nticated method ensures search results that align closely with\\nboth the explicit and implicit intentions of the user, leading to\\nmore insightful and relevant information discovery.\\n\\nRouting. The RAG system’s retrieval process utilizes di-\\nverse sources, differing in domain, language, and format,\\nwhich can be either alternated or merged based on the sit-\\nuation [Li et al., 2023b]. Query routing decides the subse-\\nquent action to a user’s query, with options ranging from\\nsummarization, searching specific databases, or merging dif-\\nferent pathways into a single response. The query router also\\nchooses the appropriate data store for the query, which may\\ninclude various sources like vector stores, graph databases, or\\nrelational databases, or a hierarchy of indices—for instance, a\\nsummary index and a document block vector index for multi-\\ndocument storage. The query router’s decision-making is pre-\\ndefined and executed via LLMs calls, which direct the query\\nto the chosen index.\\n\\nPredict . It addresses the common issues of redundancy\\nand noise in retrieved content. Instead of directly retrieving\\nfrom a data source, this module utilizes the LLM to generate\\nthe necessary context [Yu et al., 2022]. The content produced\\nby the LLM is more likely to contain pertinent information\\ncompared to that obtained through direct retrieval.\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '5'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Task Adapter. This module focuses on adapting RAG to a\\nvariety of downstream tasks. UPRISE automates the retrieval\\nof prompts for zero-shot task inputs from a pre-constructed\\ndata pool, thereby enhancing universality across tasks and\\nmodels [Cheng et al., 2023a]. Meanwhile, PROMPTAGA-\\nTOR [Dai et al., 2022] utilizes LLM as a few-shot query gen-\\nerator and, based on the generated data, creates task-specific\\nretrievers. By leveraging the generalization capability of\\nLLMs, it enables the development of task-specific end-to-end\\nretrievers with minimal examples.\\n\\nNew Patterns\\n\\nThe organizational structure of Modular RAG is highly adapt-\\nable, allowing for the substitution or rearrangement of mod-\\nules within the RAG process to suit specific problem contexts.\\nNaive RAG and Advanced RAG can both be considered as\\nbeing composed of some fixed modules. As illustrated in the\\nfigure 3, Naive RAG primarily consists of the “Retrieve” and\\n“Read” modules. A typical pattern of Advanced RAG builds\\nupon the foundation of Naive RAG by adding “Rewrite” and\\n“Rerank” modules. However, on the whole, modular RAG\\nenjoys greater diversity and flexibility.\\n\\nCurrent research primarily explores two organizational\\nparadigms. The first involves adding or replacing modules,\\nwhile the second focuses on adjusting the organizational flow\\nbetween modules. This flexibility enables tailoring the RAG\\nprocess to effectively address a wide array of tasks.\\n\\nAdding or Replacing Modules.The strategy of introducing\\nor substituting modules involves maintaining the core struc-\\nture of the Retrieval-Read process while integrating addi-\\ntional modules to enhance specific functionalities. The RRR\\nmodel [Ma et al., 2023a] introduces the Rewrite-Retrieve-\\nRead process, utilizing the LLM performance as a reinforce-\\nment learning incentive for a rewriting module. This enables\\nthe rewriter to fine-tune retrieval queries, thereby improving\\nthe downstream task performance of the reader.\\n\\nSimilarly, modules can be selectively swapped in method-\\nologies like Generate-Read [Yu et al., 2022], where the\\nLLM’s generation module takes the place of the retrieval\\nmodule. The Recite-Read approach [Sun et al., 2022] trans-\\nforms external retrieval into retrieval from model weights,\\nrequiring the LLM to initially memorize task-specific infor-\\nmation and subsequently produce output capable of handling\\nknowledge-intensive natural language processing tasks.\\n\\nAdjusting the Flow between Modules.\\n\\nzheIn the realm\\nof module flow adjustment, there is a focus on enhancing\\nthe interaction between language models and retrieval mod-\\nels. DSP [Khattab et al., 2022] introduces the Demonstrate-\\nSearch-Predict framework, treating the context learning sys-\\ntem as an explicit program rather than a final task prompt,\\nleading to more effective handling of knowledge-intensive\\ntasks. The ITER-RETGEN [Shao et al., 2023] approach uti-\\nlizes generated content to guide retrieval,\\niteratively im-\\nplementing “retrieval-enhanced generation” and “generation-\\nenhanced retrieval” within a Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read\\nflow. This method demonstrates an innovative way of using\\none module’s output to improve the functionality of another.\\n\\nOptimizing the RAG Pipeline\\nThe optimization of the retrieval process aims to enhance the\\nefficiency and quality of information in RAG systems. Cur-\\nrent research focuses on integrating diverse search technolo-\\ngies, refining retrieval steps, incorporating cognitive back-\\ntracking, implementing versatile query strategies, and lever-\\naging embedding similarity. These efforts collectively strive\\nto achieve a balance between retrieval efficiency and the\\ndepth of contextual information in RAG systems.\\n\\nHybrid Search Exploration. The RAG system optimizes its\\nperformance by intelligently integrating various techniques,\\nincluding keyword-based search, semantic search, and vec-\\ntor search. This approach leverages the unique strengths of\\neach method to accommodate diverse query types and infor-\\nmation needs, ensuring consistent retrieval of highly relevant\\nand context-rich information. The use of hybrid search serves\\nas a robust supplement to retrieval strategies, thereby enhanc-\\ning the overall efficacy of the RAG pipeline.\\n\\nRecursive Retrieval and Query Engine. Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves acquiring smaller chunks during the initial retrieval\\nphase to capture key semantic meanings. Subsequently, larger\\nchunks containing more contextual information are provided\\nto the LLM in later stages of the process. This two-step re-\\ntrieval method helps to strike a balance between efficiency\\nand the delivery of contextually rich responses.\\n\\nStepBack-prompt approach encourages the LLM to move\\naway from specific instances and engage in reasoning around\\nbroader concepts and principles [Zheng et al., 2023]. Experi-\\nmental results demonstrate a significant performance increase\\nin various challenging, inference-based tasks when backward\\nprompts are used, highlighting their natural adaptability to the\\nRAG process. These retrieval-enhancing steps can be applied\\nboth in generating responses to backward prompts and in the\\nfinal question-answering process.\\n\\nSub-Queries. Depending on the scenario, various query\\nstrategies can be employed, such as using query engines\\nprovided by frameworks like LlamaIndex, leveraging tree\\nqueries, utilizing vector queries, or executing simple sequen-\\ntial querying of chunks.\\n\\nHypothetical Document Embeddings. HyDE operates on\\nthe belief that the answers generated might be closer in the\\nembedding space than a direct query. Using the LLM, HyDE\\ncreates a hypothetical document (answer) in response to a\\nquery, embeds this document, and uses the resulting em-\\nbedding to retrieve real documents similar to the hypotheti-\\ncal one. Instead of seeking embedding similarity based on\\nthe query, this approach focuses on the embedding similar-\\nity from one answer to another [Gao et al., 2022]. However,\\nit might not consistently produce desirable outcomes, espe-\\ncially when the language model is unfamiliar with the subject\\nmatter, potentially leading to more instances with errors.\\n\\n4 Retrieval\\n\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve rel-\\nevant documents from the data source. However, creating a\\nproficient retriever presents significant challenges. This sec-\\ntionelves into three fundamental questions: 1) How can we\\nachieve accurate semantic representations? 2) What methods\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '6'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='can align the semantic spaces of queries and documents? 3)\\nHow can the retriever’s output be aligned with the preferences\\nof the Large Language Model?\\n\\nThe combination of these diverse methods has led to no-\\ntable advancements, resulting in enhanced retrieval outcomes\\nand improved performance for RAG.\\n\\n4.1 Enhancing Semantic Representations\\nIn RAG, the semantic space is essential as it involves the mul-\\ntidimensional mapping of queries and documents. Retrieval\\naccuracy in this semantic space significantly impacts RAG\\noutcomes. This section will present two methods for building\\naccurate semantic spaces.\\n\\nChunk optimization\\nWhen managing external documents, the initial step involves\\nbreaking them down into smaller chunks to extract fine-\\ngrained features, which are then embedded to represent their\\nsemantics. However, embedding overly large or excessively\\nsmall text chunks may lead to sub-optimal outcomes. There-\\nfore, identifying the optimal chunk size for documents within\\nthe corpus is crucial to ensuring the accuracy and relevance\\nof the retrieved results.\\n\\nChoosing an appropriate chunking strategy requires care-\\nful consideration of several vital factors, such as the nature\\nof the indexed content, the embedding model and its opti-\\nmal block size, the expected length and complexity of user\\nqueries, and the specific application’s utilization of the re-\\ntrieved results. For instance, the selection of a chunking\\nmodel should be based on the content’s length—whether it\\nis longer or shorter. Additionally, different embedding mod-\\nels demonstrate distinct performance characteristics at vary-\\ning block sizes. For example, sentence-transformer performs\\nbetter with single sentences, while text-embedding-ada-002\\nexcels with blocks containing 256 or 512 tokens.\\n\\nAdditionally, factors like the length and complexity of user\\ninput questions, and the specific needs of the application (e.g.,\\nsemantic search or question answering), have effect on the\\nchoice of a chunking strategy. This choice can be directly in-\\nfluenced by the token limits of the selected LLMs, requiring\\nadjustments to the block size. In reality, getting precise query\\nresults involves flexibly applying different chunking strate-\\ngies. There is no one-size-fits-all ”best” strategy, only the\\nmost appropriate one for a particular context.\\n\\nCurrent research in RAG explores various block optimiza-\\ntion techniques aimed at improving both retrieval efficiency\\nand accuracy. One such approach involves the use of slid-\\ning window technology, enabling layered retrieval by merg-\\ning globally related information across multiple retrieval pro-\\ncesses. Another strategy, known as the “small2big” method,\\nutilizes small text blocks during the initial search phase and\\nsubsequently provides larger related text blocks to the lan-\\nguage model for processing.\\n\\nThe abstract embedding technique prioritizes top K re-\\ntrieval based on document abstracts (or summaries), offering\\na comprehensive understanding of the entire document con-\\ntext. Additionally, the metadata filtering technique leverages\\ndocument metadata to enhance the filtering process. An in-\\nnovative approach, the graph indexing technique, transforms\\nentities and relationships into nodes and connections, sig-\\nnificantly improving relevance, particularly in the context of\\nmulti-hop problems.\\n\\nFine-tuning Embedding Models\\nOnce the appropriate size of chunks is determined,\\nthe\\nnext crucial step involves embedding these chunks and the\\nquery into the semantic space using an embedding model.\\nThe effectiveness of the embedding is critical as it impacts\\nthe model’s ability to represent the corpus. Recent re-\\nsearch has introduced prominent embedding models such as\\nAngIE, Voyage, BGE,etc [Li and Li, 2023, VoyageAI, 2023,\\nBAAI, 2023]. These models have undergone pre-training on\\nextensive corpora. However, their capability to accurately\\ncapture domain-specific information may be limited when ap-\\nplied to specialized domains.\\n\\nMoreover, task-specific fine-tuning of embedding models\\nis essential to ensure that the model comprehends the user\\nquery in terms of content relevance. A model without fine-\\ntuning may not adequately address the requirements of a spe-\\ncific task. Consequently, fine-tuning an embedding model be-\\ncomes crucial for downstream applications. There are two\\nprimary paradigms in embedding fine-tuning methods.\\n\\nDomain Knowledge Fine-tuning. To ensure that an embed-\\nding model accurately captures domain-specific information,\\nit is imperative to utilize domain-specific datasets for fine-\\ntuning. This process diverges from standard language model\\nfine-tuning, chiefly in the nature of the datasets involved.\\nTypically, the dataset for embedding model fine-tuning en-\\ncompasses three principal elements: queries, a corpus, and\\nrelevant documents. The model employs these queries to\\nidentify pertinent documents within the corpus. The effi-\\ncacy of the model is then gauged based on its ability to re-\\ntrieve these relevant documents in response to the queries.\\nThe dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and evalua-\\ntion phases each present distinct challenges. The LlamaIn-\\ndex [Liu, 2023] introduces a suite of pivotal classes and func-\\ntions designed to enhance the embedding model fine-tuning\\nworkflow, thereby simplifying these intricate processes. By\\ncurating a corpus infused with domain knowledge and lever-\\naging the methodologies offered, one can adeptly fine-tune an\\nembedding model to align closely with the specific require-\\nments of the target domain.\\n\\nFine-tuning for Downstream Tasks. Fine-tuning embed-\\nding models for downstream tasks is a critical step in en-\\nhancing model performance. In the realm of utilizing RAG\\nfor these tasks, innovative methods have emerged to fine-\\ntune embedding models by harnessing the capabilities of\\nLLMs. For example, PROMPTAGATOR [Dai et al., 2022]\\nutilizes the LLM as a few-shot query generator to cre-\\nate task-specific retrievers, addressing challenges in super-\\nvised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce domains. An-\\nother approach, LLM-Embedder [Zhang et al., 2023a], ex-\\nploits LLMs to generate reward signals for data across mul-\\ntiple downstream tasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two\\ntypes of supervised signals: hard labels for the dataset and\\nsoft rewards from the LLMs. This dual-signal approach fos-\\nters a more effective fine-tuning process, tailoring the embed-\\nding model to diverse downstream applications.\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '7'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='While these methods improve semantic representation\\nby incorporating domain knowledge and task-specific fine-\\ntuning, retrievers may not always exhibit optimal compatibil-\\nity with certain LLMs. To address this, some researchers have\\nexplored direct supervision of the fine-tuning process using\\nfeedback from LLMs. This direct supervision seeks to align\\nthe retriever more closely with the LLM, thereby improving\\nperformance on downstream tasks. A more comprehensive\\ndiscussion on this topic is presented in Section 4.3.\\n\\n4.2 Aligning Queries and Documents\\n\\nIn the context of RAG applications, retrievers may utilize\\na single embedding model for encoding both the query and\\nthe documents, or employ separate models for each. Addi-\\ntionally, the user’s original query may suffer from imprecise\\nphrasing and lack of semantic information. Therefore, it is\\ncrucial to align the semantic space of the user’s query with\\nthose of the documents. This section introduces two funda-\\nmental techniques aimed at achieving this alignment.\\n\\nQuery Rewriting\\nQuery rewriting is a fundamental approach for aligning\\nthe semantics of a query and a document. Methods\\nsuch as Query2Doc and ITER-RETGEN leverage LLMs\\nto create a pseudo-document by combining the origi-\\nnal query with additional guidance [Wang et al., 2023c,\\nShao et al., 2023]. HyDE constructs query vectors using\\ntextual cues to generate a “hypothetical” document captur-\\ning essential patterns [Gao et al., 2022]. RRR introduces a\\nframework that reverses the traditional retrieval and read-\\ning order, focusing on query rewriting [Ma et al., 2023a].\\nSTEP-BACKPROMPTING enables LLMs to perform ab-\\nstract reasoning and retrieval based on high-level con-\\ncepts [Zheng et al., 2023]. Additionally, the multi-query re-\\ntrieval method utilizes LLMs to generate and execute multiple\\nsearch queries simultaneously, advantageous for addressing\\ncomplex problems with multiple sub-problems.\\n\\nEmbedding Transformation\\nBeyond broad strategies such as query rewriting, there exist\\nmore granular techniques specifically designed for embed-\\nding transformations. LlamaIndex [Liu, 2023] exemplifies\\nthis by introducing an adapter module that can be integrated\\nfollowing the query encoder. This adapter facilitates fine-\\ntuning, thereby optimizing the representation of query em-\\nbeddings to map them into a latent space that is more closely\\naligned with the intended tasks.\\n\\nThe challenge of aligning queries with structured exter-\\nnal documents, particularly when addressing the incongruity\\nbetween structured and unstructured data, is addressed by\\nSANTA [Li et al., 2023d].\\nIt enhances the retriever’s sen-\\nsitivity to structured information through two pre-training\\nstrategies: first, by leveraging the intrinsic alignment between\\nstructured and unstructured data to inform contrastive learn-\\ning in a structured-aware pre-training scheme; and second, by\\nimplementing Masked Entity Prediction. The latter utilizes\\nan entity-centric masking strategy that encourages language\\nmodels to predict and fill in the masked entities, thereby fos-\\ntering a deeper understanding of structured data.\\n\\nThe issue of aligning queries with structured exter-\\nnal documents, especially when dealing with the dispar-\\nity between structured and unstructured data, is tackled by\\nSANTA [Li et al., 2023d]. This approach improves the re-\\ntriever’s ability to recognize structured information through\\ntwo pre-training strategies: firstly, by utilizing the inher-\\nent alignment between structured and unstructured data to\\nguide contrastive learning in a structured-aware pre-training\\nscheme; and secondly, by employing Masked Entity Predic-\\ntion. The latter uses an entity-centric masking strategy to\\nprompt language models to predict and complete the masked\\nentities, thus promoting a more profound comprehension of\\nstructured data.\\n\\n4.3 Aligning Retriever and LLM\\n\\nIn the RAG pipeline, enhancing retrieval hit rate through var-\\nious techniques may not necessarily improve the final out-\\ncome, as the retrieved documents may not align with the spe-\\ncific requirements of the LLMs. Therefore, this section in-\\ntroduces two methods aimed at aligning the retriever outputs\\nwith the preferences of the LLMs.\\n\\nFine-tuning Retrievers\\nSeveral studies utilize feedback signals from LLMs to refine\\nretrieval models. For instance, AAR [Yu et al., 2023b] intro-\\nduces supervisory signals for a pre-trained retriever using an\\nencoder-decoder architecture. This is achieved by identifying\\nthe LM’s preferred documents through FiD cross-attention\\nscores. Subsequently, the retriever undergoes fine-tuning\\nwith hard negative sampling and standard cross-entropy loss.\\nUltimately, the refined retriever can be directly applied to en-\\nhance unseen target LMs, resulting in improved performance\\nin the target task. Additionally, it is suggested that LLMs\\nmay have a preference for focusing on readable rather than\\ninformation-rich documents.\\n\\nREPLUG [Shi et al., 2023] utilizes a retriever and an LLM\\nto calculate the probability distributions of the retrieved doc-\\numents and then performs supervised training by computing\\nthe KL divergence. This straightforward and effective train-\\ning method enhances the performance of the retrieval model\\nby using an LM as the supervisory signal, eliminating the\\nneed for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\\n\\nUPRISE [Cheng et al., 2023a] also employs frozen LLMs\\nto fine-tune the prompt retriever. Both the LLM and the re-\\ntriever take prompt-input pairs as inputs and utilize the scores\\nprovided by the LLM to supervise the retriever’s training, ef-\\nfectively treating the LLM as a dataset labeler. In addition,\\nAtlas [Izacard et al., 2022] proposes four methods of super-\\nvised fine-tuning embedding models:\\n\\n• Attention Distillation. This approach employs cross-\\nattention scores generated by the LLM during output to\\ndistill the model’s knowledge.\\n\\n• EMDR2. By using the Expectation-Maximization algo-\\nrithm, this method trains the model with retrieved docu-\\nments as latent variables.\\n\\n• Perplexity Distillation directly trains the model using the\\n\\nperplexity of generated tokens as an indicator.\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '8'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• LOOP. This method presents a novel loss function based\\non the impact of document deletion on LLM prediction,\\noffering an efficient training strategy to better adapt the\\nmodel to specific tasks.\\n\\nThese approaches aim to improve the synergy between the\\nretriever and the LLM, leading to enhanced retrieval perfor-\\nmance and more accurate responses to user inquiries.\\n\\nAdapters\\nFine-tuning models may present challenges, such as integrat-\\ning functionality through an API or addressing constraints\\narising from limited local computational resources. Con-\\nsequently, some approaches opt to incorporate an external\\nadapter to aid in alignment.\\n\\nPRCA trains the adapter through a context extraction\\nThe retriever’s out-\\nphase and a reward-driven phase.\\nput\\nis then optimized using a token-based autoregres-\\nsive strategy [Yang et al., 2023b]. The token filtering ap-\\nproach employs cross-attention scores to efficiently fil-\\nter tokens, selecting only the highest-scoring input\\nto-\\nkens [Berchansky et al., 2023].RECOMP introduces both ex-\\ntractive and generative compressors for summary generation.\\nThese compressors either select relevant sentences or syn-\\nthesize document information, creating summaries tailored to\\nmulti-document queries [Xu et al., 2023a].\\n\\nFurthermore, PKG introduces an innovative method for in-\\ntegrating knowledge into white-box models via directive fine-\\ntuning [Luo et al., 2023]. In this approach, the retriever mod-\\nule is directly substituted to generate relevant documents ac-\\ncording to a query. This method assists in addressing the dif-\\nficulties encountered during the fine-tuning process and en-\\nhances model performance.\\n\\n5 Generation\\nA crucial component of RAG is its generator, which is re-\\nsponsible for converting retrieved information into coherent\\nand fluent text. Unlike traditional language models, RAG’s\\ngenerator sets itself apart by improving accuracy and rele-\\nvance via the incorporation of retrieved data. In RAG, the\\ngenerator’s input encompasses not only typical contextual in-\\nformation but also relevant text segments obtained through\\nthe retriever. This comprehensive input enables the generator\\nto gain a deep understanding of the question’s context, result-\\ning in more informative and contextually relevant responses.\\nFurthermore, the generator is guided by the retrieved text to\\nensure coherence between the generated content and the ob-\\ntained information. The diverse input data has led to targeted\\nefforts during the generation phase, all aimed at refining the\\nadaptation of the large model to the input data derived from\\nqueries and documents. In the following subsections, we will\\nexplore the introduction of the generator by delving into as-\\npects of post-retrieval processing and fine-tuning.\\n\\n5.1 Post-retrieval with Frozen LLM\\nIn the realm of untunable LLMs , many studies rely on well-\\nestablished models like GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023] to harness\\ntheir comprehensive internal knowledge for systematically\\nsynthesizing retrieved information from various documents.\\n\\nHowever, challenges persist with these large models, includ-\\ning limitations on context length and susceptibility to redun-\\ndant information. To tackle these issues, certain research en-\\ndeavors have turned their focus to post-retrieval processing.\\n\\nPost-retrieval processing involves treating, filtering, or op-\\ntimizing the relevant information retrieved by the retriever\\nfrom a large document database. Its main goal is to enhance\\nthe quality of retrieval results, aligning them more closely\\nwith user needs or subsequent tasks. It can be viewed as a\\nreprocessing of the documents obtained during the retrieval\\nphase. Common operations in post-retrieval processing typi-\\ncally include information compression and result reranking.\\n\\nInformation Compression\\nThe retriever excels at retrieving relevant information from a\\nvast knowledge base, but managing the substantial amount of\\ninformation within retrieval documents is a challenge. Ongo-\\ning research aims to extend the context length of large lan-\\nguage models to tackle this issue. However, current large\\nmodels still struggle with context limitations. Therefore,\\nthere are scenarios where condensing information becomes\\nnecessary. Information condensation is significant for reduc-\\ning noise, addressing context length restrictions, and enhanc-\\ning generation effects.\\n\\nPRCA tackled this issue by training an information ex-\\ntractor [Yang et al., 2023b]. In the context extraction phase,\\nwhen provided with an input text Sinput, it is capable of\\nproducing an output sequence Cextracted that represents the\\ncondensed context from the input document. The train-\\ning process is designed to minimize the difference between\\nCextracted and the actual context Ctruth.\\n\\nSimilarly, RECOMP adopts a comparable approach by\\ntraining an information condenser using contrastive learn-\\ning [Xu et al., 2023a]. Each training data point consists of\\none positive sample and five negative samples, and the en-\\ncoder undergoes training using contrastive loss throughout\\nthis process [Karpukhin et al., 2020] .\\n\\nAnother study has taken a different approach by aim-\\ning to reduce the number of documents in order to im-\\nIn the study\\nprove the accuracy of the model’s answers.\\nby [Ma et al., 2023b],\\nthey propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and Small\\nLanguage Models (SLMs). In this paradigm, SLMs serve as\\nfilters, while LLMs function as reordering agents. The re-\\nsearch shows that instructing LLMs to rearrange challeng-\\ning samples identified by SLMs leads to significant improve-\\nments in various Information Extraction (IE) tasks.\\n\\nReranking\\nThe re-ranking model is pivotal in optimizing the document\\nset retrieved from the retriever. Language models often face\\nperformance declines when additional context is introduced,\\nand re-ranking effectively addresses this issue. The core con-\\ncept involves rearranging document records to prioritize the\\nmost relevant items at the top, thereby limiting the total num-\\nber of documents. This not only resolves the challenge of\\ncontext window expansion during retrieval but also enhances\\nretrieval efficiency and responsiveness.\\n\\nThe re-ranking model assumes a dual role throughout\\nthe information retrieval process, functioning as both an\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '9'}),\n",

This\\nmethod entails reducing the content of individual documents\\nand filtering the entire document, with the ultimate goal of\\npresenting the most relevant information in the search results\\nfor a more focused and accurate display of pertinent content.\\n\\n5.2 Fine-tuning LLM for RAG\\n\\nOptimizing the generator within the RAG model is a critical\\naspect of its architecture. The generator’s role is to take the\\nretrieved information and produce relevant text, forming the\\nfinal output of the model. The optimization of the generator\\naims to ensure that the generated text is both natural and ef-\\nfectively leverages the retrieved documents to better meet the\\nuser’s query needs.\\n\\nIn standard LLMs generation tasks, the input typically\\nconsists of a query. RAG stands out by incorporating not\\nonly a query but also various retrieved documents (struc-\\ntured/unstructured) by the retriever into the input. This ad-\\nditional information can significantly influence the model’s\\nunderstanding, particularly for smaller models. In such cases,\\nfine-tuning the model to adapt to the input of both query and\\nretrieved documents becomes crucial. Before presenting the\\ninput to the fine-tuned model, post-retrieval processing usu-\\nally occurs for the documents retrieved by the retriever. It is\\nessential to note that the fine-tuning method for the genera-\\ntor in RAG aligns with the general fine-tuning approach for\\nLLMs. In the following, we will briefly describe some rep-\\nresentative works involving data (formatted/unformatted) and\\noptimization functions.\\n\\nGeneral Optimization Process\\nAs part of the general optimization process, the training data\\ntypically consists of input-output pairs, aiming to train the\\nmodel to produce the output y given the input x. In the work\\nof Self-Mem [Cheng et al., 2023b], a traditional\\ntraining\\nprocess is employed, where given the input x, relevant\\ndocuments z are retrieved (selecting Top-1 in the paper), and\\nafter integrating (x, z), the model generates the output y.\\nThe paper utilizes two common paradigms for fine-tuning,\\nnamely Joint-Encoder and Dual-Encoder [Arora et al., 2023,\\nWang et al., 2022b,\\nLewis et al., 2020, Xia et al., 2019,\\nCai et al., 2021, Cheng et al., 2022].\\n\\nIn the Joint-Encoder paradigm, a standard model based on\\nan encoder-decoder is used. Here, the encoder initially en-\\ncodes the input, and the decoder, through attention mecha-\\nnisms, combines the encoded results to generate tokens in\\nan autoregressive manner. On the other hand, in the Dual-\\nEncoder paradigm, the system sets up two independent en-\\ncoders, with each encoder encoding the input (query, con-\\ntext) and the document, respectively. The resulting out-\\nputs undergo bidirectional cross-attention processing by the\\ndecoder in sequence. Both architectures utilize the Trans-\\nformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] as the foundational block and\\noptimize with Negative Log-Likelihood loss.\\n\\nUtilizing Contrastive Learning\\nIn the phase of preparing training data for language mod-\\nels, interaction pairs of input and output are usually created.\\nThis traditional method can lead to ”exposure bias,” where\\nthe model is only trained on individual, correct output ex-\\namples, thus restricting its exposure to a range of possible\\noutputs citesequence. This limitation can hinder the model’s\\nreal-world performance by causing it to overfit to the partic-\\nular examples in the training set, thereby reducing its ability\\nto generalize across various contexts.\\n\\nTo mitigate exposure bias, SURGE [Kang et al., 2023]\\nproposes the use of graph-text contrastive learning. This\\nmethod includes a contrastive learning objective that prompts\\nthe model to produce a range of plausible and coherent re-\\nsponses, expanding beyond the instances encountered in the\\ntraining data. This approach is crucial in reducing overfitting\\nand strengthening the model’s ability to generalize.\\n\\nFor retrieval tasks that engage with structured data, the\\nSANTA framework [Li et al., 2023d] implements a tripartite\\ntraining regimen to effectively encapsulate both structural and\\nsemantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on the retriever,\\nwhere contrastive learning is harnessed to refine the query\\nand document embeddings.\\n\\nSubsequently, the generator’s preliminary training stage\\nemploys contrastive learning to align the structured data with\\nits unstructured document descriptions. In a further stage of\\ngenerator training, the model acknowledges the critical role\\nof entity semantics in the representation learning of textual\\ndata for retrieval, as highlighted by [Sciavolino et al., 2021,\\nZhang et al., 2019]. This process commences with the identi-\\nfication of entities within the structured data, followed by the\\napplication of masks over these entities within the generator’s\\ninput data, thus setting the stage for the model to anticipate\\nand predict these masked elements.\\n\\nThe training regimen progresses with the model learning\\nto reconstruct the masked entities by leveraging contextual\\ninformation. This exercise cultivates the model’s comprehen-\\nsion of the textual data’s structural semantics and facilitates\\nthe alignment of pertinent entities within the structured data.\\nThe overarching optimization goal is to train the language\\nmodel to accurately restore the obscured spans, thereby en-\\nriching its understanding of entity semantics [Ye et al., 2020].\\n\\n6 Augmentation in RAG\\nThis section is structured around three key aspects: the aug-\\nmentation stage, sources of augmentation data, and the aug-\\nmentation process.

On the other hand, by con-\\nstructing directive datasets, one can demand LLMs to gen-\\nerate specific formats content. For instance, in adaptive or\\niterative retrieval scenarios, LLMs are fine-tuned to generate\\ncontent that will help determine the timing for the next step\\nof action [Jiang et al., 2023b, Asai et al., 2023].\\n\\nBy synergistically fine-tuning both the retriever and the\\ngenerator, we can enhance the model’s generalization capa-\\n\\nbilities and avoid overfitting that may arise from training them\\nseparately. However, joint fine-tuning also leads to increased\\nresource consumption. RA-DIT [Lin et al., 2023] presents\\na lightweight, dual-instruction tuning framework that can\\neffectively add retrieval capabilities to any LLMs. The\\nretrieval-enhanced directive fine-tuning updates the LLM,\\nguiding it to make more efficient use of the information re-\\ntrieved and to disregard distracting content.\\n\\nDespite its advantages, fine-tuning has limitations, includ-\\ning the need for specialized datasets for RAG fine-tuning\\nand the requirement for significant computational resources.\\nHowever, this stage allows for customizing models to specific\\nneeds and data formats, potentially reducing resource usage\\ncompared to the pre-training phase while still being able to\\nfine-tune the model’s output style.\\n\\nIn summary, the fine-tuning stage is essential for the adap-\\ntation of RAG models to specific tasks, enabling the refine-\\nment of both retrievers and generators. This stage enhances\\nthe model’s versatility and adaptability to various tasks, de-\\nspite the challenges presented by resource and dataset re-\\nquirements. The strategic fine-tuning of RAG models is\\ntherefore a critical component in the development of efficient\\nand effective retrieval-augmented systems.\\n\\nInference Stage\\nThe inference stage in RAG models is crucial, as it in-\\nvolves extensive integration with LLMs. Traditional RAG\\napproaches, also known as Naive RAG, involve incorporating\\nretrieval content at this stage to guide the generation process.\\nTo overcome the limitations of Naive RAG, advanced tech-\\nniques introduce more contextually rich information dur-\\ning inference. The DSP framework [Khattab et al., 2022]\\nutilizes a sophisticated exchange of natural language text\\nbetween fronzen LMs and retrieval models (RMs), en-\\nriching the context and thereby improving generation out-\\ncomes. The PKG [Luo et al., 2023] method equips LLMs\\nwith a knowledge-guided module that allows for the retrieval\\nof pertinent information without modifying the LMs’ pa-\\nrameters, enabling more complex task execution. CREA-\\nICL [Li et al., 2023b] employs a synchronous retrieval of\\ncross-lingual knowledge to enhance context, while RE-\\nCITE [Sun et al., 2022] generates context by sampling para-\\ngraphs directly from LLMs.\\n\\nFurther refinement of the RAG process during infer-\\nence is seen in approaches that cater to tasks necessi-\\nITRG [Feng et al., 2023] it-\\ntating multi-step reasoning.\\neratively retrieves information to identify the correct rea-\\nITER-\\nsoning paths, thereby improving task adaptability.\\nRETGEN [Shao et al., 2023]\\nfollows an iterative strat-\\negy, merging retrieval and generation in a cyclical pro-\\ncess that alternates between “retrieval-enhanced generation”\\nand “generation-enhanced retrieval”. For non-knowledge-\\nintensive (NKI) tasks, PGRA [Guo et al., 2023] proposes a\\ntwo-stage framework, starting with a task-agnostic retriever\\nfollowed by a prompt-guided reranker to select and priori-\\ntize evidence. In contrast, IRCOT [Trivedi et al., 2022] com-\\nbines RAG with Chain of Thought (CoT) methodologies, al-\\nternating CoT-guided retrievals with retrieval-informed CoT\\nprocesses, significantly boosting GPT-3’s performance across\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '12'}),\n",

The principal advantage is maintaining static LLM\\nparameters while supplying contextually relevant information\\nto meet specific task demands. Nevertheless, this approach is\\nnot without limitations, as it requires meticulous data pro-\\ncessing and optimization, and is bound by the foundational\\nmodel’s intrinsic capabilities. To address diverse task require-\\nments effectively, this method is often paired with procedural\\noptimization techniques such as step-wise reasoning, iterative\\nretrieval, and adaptive retrieval strategies.\\n\\n6.2 Augmentation Source\\nThe effectiveness of RAG models is heavily impacted by the\\nselection of data sources for augmentation. Different levels of\\nknowledge and dimensions require distinct processing tech-\\nniques. They are categorized as unstructured data, structured\\ndata, and content generated by LLMs. The technology tree\\nof representative RAG research with different augmentation\\naspects is depicted in Figure 5. The leaves, colored in three\\ndifferent shades, represent enhancements using various types\\nof data: unstructured data, structured data, and content gener-\\nated by LLMs. The diagram clearly shows that initially, aug-\\nmentation was mainly achieved through unstructured data,\\nsuch as pure text. This approach later expanded to include\\nthe use of structured data (e.g. knowledge graph) for further\\nimprovement. More recently, there has been a growing trend\\nin research that utilizes content generated by the LLMs them-\\nselves for retrieval and augmentation purposes.\\n\\nAugmented with Unstructured Data\\nUnstructured text, is gathered from corpora, such as prompt\\ndata for fine-tuning large models [Cheng et al., 2023a] and\\ncross-lingual data [Li et al., 2023b]. Retrieval units vary from\\ntokens (e.g., kNN-LM [Khandelwal et al., 2019]) to phrases\\n(e.g., NPM, COG [Lee et al., 2020, Lan et al., 2022]) and\\ndocument paragraphs, with finer granularities offering pre-\\ncision at the cost of increased retrieval complexity.\\n\\nFLARE [Jiang et al., 2023b]\\n\\nintroduces an active re-\\ntrieval approach, triggered by the LM’s generation of low-\\nprobability words. It creates a temporary sentence for doc-\\nument retrieval, then regenerates the sentence with the re-\\ntrieved context to predict subsequent sentences. RETRO uses\\nthe previous chunk to retrieve the nearest neighbor at the\\nchunk level, combined with the previous chunk’s context, it\\nguides the generation of the next chunk. To preserve causal-\\nity, the generation of the next block Ci only utilizes the near-\\nest neighbor of the previous block N (Ci−1) and not N (Ci).\\n\\nAugmented with Structured Data\\nStructured data, such as knowledge graphs (KGs), pro-\\nvide high-quality context and mitigate model hallucina-\\nRET-LLMs [Modarressi et al., 2023] constructs a\\ntions.\\nknowledge graph memory from past dialogues for future ref-\\nerence. SUGRE [Kang et al., 2023] employs Graph Neu-\\nral Networks (GNNs) to encode relevant KG subgraphs,\\nensuring consistency between retrieved facts and gener-\\nated text through multi-modal contrastive learning. Knowl-\\n\\nedGPT [Wang et al., 2023d] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness and contextuality.\\n\\nLLMs-Generated Content in RAG\\nAddressing the limitations of external auxiliary information\\nin RAG, some research has focused on exploiting LLMs’ in-\\nternal knowledge. SKR [Wang et al., 2023e] classifies ques-\\ntions as known or unknown, applying retrieval enhancement\\nselectively. GenRead [Yu et al., 2022] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated con-\\ntexts often contain more accurate answers due to better align-\\nment with the pre-training objectives of causal language mod-\\neling. Selfmem [Cheng et al., 2023b] iteratively creates an\\nunbounded memory pool with a retrieval-enhanced genera-\\ntor, using a memory selector to choose outputs that serve as\\ndual problems to the original question, thus self-enhancing\\nthe generative model.\\n\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model per-\\nformance and task effectiveness.\\n\\n6.3 Augmentation Process\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular retrieval step followed by generation, which can\\ntermed the “lost\\nlead to inefficiencies. A notable issue,\\nin the middle” phenomenon, arises when a single retrieval\\nyields redundant content that may dilute or contradict es-\\nsential information, thereby degrading the generation qual-\\nity [Liu et al., 2023a]. Furthermore, such singular retrieval is\\ntypically insufficient for complex problems demanding multi-\\nstep reasoning, as it provides a limited scope of informa-\\ntion [Yoran et al., 2023].\\n\\nAs illustrated in Figure 5, to circumvent these challenges,\\ncontemporary research has proposed methods for refining the\\nretrieval process:\\niterative retrieval, recursive retrieval and\\nadaptive retrieval. Iterative retrieval allows the model to en-\\ngage in multiple retrieval cycles, enhancing the depth and\\nrelevance of the information obtained. Recursive retrieval\\nprocess where the results of one retrieval operation are used\\nas the input for the subsequent retrieval.\\nIt helps to delve\\ndeeper into relevant information, particularly when dealing\\nwith complex or multi-step queries. Recursive retrieval is of-\\nten used in scenarios where a gradual approach is needed to\\nconverge on a final answer, such as in academic research, le-\\ngal case analysis, or certain types of data mining tasks. Adap-\\ntive retrieval, on the other hand, offers a dynamic adjustment\\nmechanism, tailoring the retrieval process to the specific de-\\nmands of varying tasks and contexts.\\n\\nIterative Retrieval\\nIterative retrieval in RAG models is a process where doc-\\numents are repeatedly collected based on the initial query\\nand the text generated thus far, providing a more compre-\\nhensive knowledge base for LLMs [Borgeaud et al., 2022,\\nArora et al., 2023]. This approach has been shown to en-\\nhance the robustness of subsequent answer generation by of-\\nfering additional contextual references through multiple re-\\ntrieval iterations. However, it may suffer from semantic dis-\\ncontinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information, as\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '13'}),\n",

Techniques such as prompt engi-\\nneering, Fine-Tuning (FT), and RAG each have distinct char-\\nacteristics, visually represented in Figure 6. While prompt\\nengineering leverages a model’s inherent capabilities, opti-\\nmizing LLMs often requires the application of both RAG and\\nFT methods. The choice between RAG and FT should be\\nbased on the specific requirements of the scenario and the in-\\nherent properties of each approach. A detailed comparison of\\nRAG and FT is presented in Table 1.\\n\\n6.4 RAG vs Fine-Tuning\\n\\nRAG is like giving a model a textbook for tailored informa-\\ntion retrieval, perfect for specific queries.

RAG’s efficacy is limited by the context\\nwindow size of Large Language Models (LLMs). Balancing\\nthe trade-off between a window that is too short, risking insuf-\\nficient information, and one that is too long, risking informa-\\ntion dilution, is crucial. With ongoing efforts to expand LLM\\ncontext windows to virtually unlimited sizes, the adaptation\\nof RAG to these changes presents a significant research ques-\\ntion [Xu et al., 2023c, Packer et al., 2023, Xiao et al., 2023].\\nRobustness. The presence of noise or contradictory infor-\\nmation during retrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s out-\\n\\nput quality. This situation is figuratively referred to as “Mis-\\ninformation can be worse than no information at all”.\\nIm-\\nproving RAG’s resistance to such adversarial or counterfac-\\ntual inputs is gaining research momentum and has become a\\nkey performance metric [Yu et al., 2023a, Glass et al., 2021,\\nBaek et al., 2023].\\n\\nHybrid Approaches (RAG+FT). Combining RAG with\\nfine-tuning is emerging as a leading strategy. Determining the\\noptimal integration of RAG and fine-tuning whether sequen-\\ntial, alternating, or through end-to-end joint training—and\\nhow to harness both parameterized and non-parameterized\\nadvantages are areas ripe for exploration [Lin et al., 2023].\\n\\nExpanding LLM Roles. Beyond generating final answers,\\nLLMs are leveraged for retrieval and evaluation within RAG\\nframeworks. Identifying ways to further unlock LLMs poten-\\ntial in RAG systems is a growing research direction.\\n\\nScaling Laws.

Additionally,\\nKNN-based attention fusion leverages audio embeddings and\\nsemantically related text embeddings to refine ASR, thereby\\naccelerating domain adaptation.

RBPS [Nashid et al., 2023] excels in small-scale\\nlearning tasks by retrieving code examples that align with de-\\nvelopers’ objectives through encoding and frequency analy-\\nsis.

For structured\\nknowledge, the CoK method [Li et al., 2023c] first extracts\\nfacts pertinent to the input query from a knowledge graph,\\nthen integrates these facts as hints within the input, enhancing\\nperformance in knowledge graph question-answering tasks.\\n\\n8.2 Ecosystem of RAG\\nDownstream Tasks and Evaluation\\nRAG has shown considerable promise in enriching language\\nmodels with the capacity to handle intricate queries and pro-\\nduce detailed responses by leveraging extensive knowledge\\nbases. Empirical evidence suggests that RAG excels in a\\nvariety of downstream tasks, including open-ended question\\nanswering and fact verification. The integration of RAG not\\nonly bolsters the precision and relevance of responses but also\\ntheir diversity and depth.\\n\\n9https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize\\n\\nThe scalability and versatility of RAG across multiple do-\\nmains warrant further investigation, particularly in special-\\nized fields such as medicine, law, and education. In these ar-\\neas, RAG could potentially reduce training costs and enhance\\nperformance compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches\\nin professional domain knowledge question answering.\\n\\nConcurrently, refining the evaluation framework for RAG\\nis essential to maximize its efficacy and utility across different\\ntasks. This entails the development of nuanced metrics and\\nassessment tools that can gauge aspects such as contextual\\nrelevance, creativity of content, and non-maleficence.\\n\\nFurthermore, improving the interpretability of RAG-driven\\nmodels continues to be a key goal. Doing so would allow\\nusers to understand the reasoning behind the responses gener-\\nated by the model, thereby promoting trust and transparency\\nin the use of RAG applications.\\n\\nTechnical Stack\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG-\\nrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.\\n\\nEmerging technical stacks, while not as feature-rich as\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, distinguish themselves with\\nspecialized offerings. For instance, Flowise AI10 prioritizes a\\nlow-code approach, enabling users to deploy AI applications,\\nincluding RAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop inter-\\nface. Other technologies like HayStack, Meltano11, and Co-\\nhere Coral12 are also gaining attention for their unique con-\\ntributions to the field.\\n\\nIn addition to AI-focused providers, traditional software\\nand cloud service providers are expanding their offerings to\\ninclude RAG-centric services. Verba13 from Weaviate is de-\\nsigned for personal assistant applications, while Amazon’s\\nKendra14 provides an intelligent enterprise search service, al-\\nlowing users to navigate through various content repositories\\nusing built-in connectors. During the evolution of the RAG\\ntechnology landscape, there has been a clear divergence to-\\nwards different specializations, such as: 1) Customization.\\nTailoring RAG to meet a specific requirements. 2) Simpli-\\nfication. Making RAG easier to use, thereby reducing the ini-\\ntial learning curve. 3) Specialization. Refining RAG to serve\\nproduction environments more effectively.\\n\\nThe mutual growth of RAG models and their technical\\nstack is evident; technological advancements consistently es-\\ntablish new standards for the existing infrastructure. In turn,\\nenhancements to the technical stack drive the evolution of\\nRAG capabilities. The RAG toolkit is converging into a foun-\\ndational technical stack, laying the groundwork for advanced\\nenterprise applications. However, the concept of a fully in-\\ntegrated, comprehensive platform remains on the horizon,\\npending further innovation and development.\\n\\n10https://flowiseai.com\\n11https://meltano.com\\n12https://cohere.com/coral\\n13https://github.com/weaviate/Verba\\n14https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/\\n\\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '19'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 7: Summary of RAG ecosystem\\n\\n9 Conclusion\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 7, high-\\nlights RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the ca-\\npabilities of LLMs through the integration of parameter-\\nized knowledge from language models with extensive non-\\nparameterized data from external knowledge bases. Our sur-\\nvey illustrates the evolution of RAG technologies and their\\nimpact on knowledge-intensive tasks. Our analysis delin-\\neates three developmental paradigms within the RAG frame-\\nwork: Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG, each marking\\na progressive enhancement over its predecessors. The Ad-\\nvanced RAG paradigm extends beyond the Naive approach\\nby incorporating sophisticated architectural elements, includ-\\ning query rewriting, chunk reranking, and prompt summariza-\\ntion. These innovations have led to a more nuanced and mod-\\nular architecture that enhances both the performance and the\\ninterpretability of LLMs. RAG’s technical integration with\\nother AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforce-\\nment learning, has further expanded its capabilities. In con-\\ntent retrieval, a hybrid methodology that leverages both struc-\\ntured and unstructured data sources is emerging as a trend,\\nproviding a more enriched retrieval process. Cutting-edge re-\\nsearch within the RAG framework is exploring novel con-\\ncepts such as self-retrieval from LLMs and the dynamic tim-\\ning of information retrieval.\\n\\nDespite the strides made in RAG technology, research op-\\nportunities abound in improving its robustness and its abil-\\nity to manage extended contexts. RAG’s application scope is\\nalso widening into multimodal domains, adapting its princi-\\n\\nples to interpret and process diverse data forms such as im-\\nages, videos, and code. This expansion underscores RAG’s\\nsignificant practical implications for AI deployment, attract-\\ning interest from both academic and industrial sectors. The\\ngrowing ecosystem of RAG is underscored by an increase in\\nRAG-centric AI applications and the ongoing development\\nof supportive tools. However, as RAG’s application land-\\nscape expands, there is an imperative need to refine evaluation\\nmethodologies to keep pace with its evolution. Ensuring that\\nperformance assessments remain accurate and representative\\nis crucial for capturing the full extent of RAG’s contributions\\nto the AI research and development community.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[Alon et al., 2022] Uri Alon, Frank Xu, Junxian He, Sudipta\\nSengupta, Dan Roth, and Graham Neubig.\\nNeuro-\\nsymbolic language modeling with automaton-augmented\\nretrieval.

A common issue is\\nthe generation of\\ninformation, or ”hallucina-\\ntions” [Zhang et al., 2023b], especially when queries extend\\nbeyond the model’s training data or necessitate up-to-date in-\\nformation. These shortcomings underscore the impractical-\\nity of deploying LLMs as black-box solutions in real-world\\nproduction environments without additional safeguards. One\\npromising approach to mitigate these limitations is Retrieval-\\nAugmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external\\ndata retrieval into the generative process, thereby enhancing\\nthe model’s ability to provide accurate and relevant responses.\\nRAG, introduced by Lewis et al. [Lewis et al., 2020] in\\nmid-2020, stands as a paradigm within the realm of LLMs,\\nenhancing generative tasks. Specifically, RAG involves an\\ninitial retrieval step where the LLMs query an external data\\nsource to obtain relevant information before proceeding to an-\\nswer questions or generate text. This process not only informs\\nthe subsequent generation phase but also ensures that the re-\\nsponses are grounded in retrieved evidence, thereby signif-\\nicantly enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the output.\\nThe dynamic retrieval of information from knowledge bases\\nduring the inference phase allows RAG to address issues such\\nas the generation of factually incorrect content, commonly\\nreferred to as “hallucinations.” The integration of RAG into\\nLLMs has seen rapid adoption and has become a pivotal tech-\\nnology in refining the capabilities of chatbots and rendering\\nLLMs more viable for practical applications.\\n\\nThe evolutionary trajectory of RAG unfolds across four\\ndistinctive phases, as illustrated in Figure 1.\\nIn its in-\\nception in 2017, aligned with the emergence of the Trans-\\nformer architecture, the primary thrust was on assimilating\\nadditional knowledge through Pre-Training Models (PTM)\\nto augment language models. This epoch witnessed RAG’s\\nfoundational efforts predominantly directed at optimizing\\npre-training methodologies.\\n\\nFollowing this initial phase, a period of relative dormancy\\nensued before the advent of chatGPT, during which there was\\nminimal advancement in related research for RAG. The sub-\\nsequent arrival of chatGPT marked a pivotal moment in the\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c'"
