How does RAG's technical integration with other AI methodologies enhance its capabilities?,"['Figure 7: Summary of RAG ecosystem\n\n9 Conclusion\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 7, high-\nlights RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the ca-\npabilities of LLMs through the integration of parameter-\nized knowledge from language models with extensive non-\nparameterized data from external knowledge bases. Our sur-\nvey illustrates the evolution of RAG technologies and their\nimpact on knowledge-intensive tasks. Our analysis delin-\neates three developmental paradigms within the RAG frame-\nwork: Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG, each marking\na progressive enhancement over its predecessors. The Ad-\nvanced RAG paradigm extends beyond the Naive approach\nby incorporating sophisticated architectural elements, includ-\ning query rewriting, chunk reranking, and prompt summariza-\ntion. These innovations have led to a more nuanced and mod-\nular architecture that enhances both the performance and the\ninterpretability of LLMs. RAG’s technical integration with\nother AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforce-\nment learning, has further expanded its capabilities. In con-\ntent retrieval, a hybrid methodology that leverages both struc-\ntured and unstructured data sources is emerging as a trend,\nproviding a more enriched retrieval process. Cutting-edge re-\nsearch within the RAG framework is exploring novel con-\ncepts such as self-retrieval from LLMs and the dynamic tim-\ning of information retrieval.\n\nDespite the strides made in RAG technology, research op-\nportunities abound in improving its robustness and its abil-\nity to manage extended contexts. RAG’s application scope is\nalso widening into multimodal domains, adapting its princi-\n\nples to interpret and process diverse data forms such as im-\nages, videos, and code.

BLIP-2 [Li et al., 2023a] leverages frozen\nimage encoders alongside LLMs for efficient visual language\npre-training, enabling zero-shot image-to-text conversions.\nThe “Visualize Before You Write” method [Zhu et al., 2022]\nemploys image generation to steer the LM’s text generation,\nshowing promise in open-ended text generation tasks.\n\nAudio and Video. The GSS method retrieves and stitches\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\nspeech-translated data [Zhao et al., 2022]. UEOP marks\na significant advancement in end-to-end automatic speech\nrecognition by incorporating external, offline strategies for\nvoice-to-text conversion [Chan et al., 2023].

Vid2Seq augments language\nmodels with specialized temporal markers, facilitating the\nprediction of event boundaries and textual descriptions within\na unified output sequence [Yang et al., 2023a].\n\nCode. RBPS [Nashid et al., 2023] excels in small-scale\nlearning tasks by retrieving code examples that align with de-\nvelopers’ objectives through encoding and frequency analy-\nsis.

How is contrastive learning used in the training of the language model?,"['ulate both structural and\nsemantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on the retriever,\nwhere contrastive learning is harnessed to refine the query\nand document embeddings.\n\nSubsequently, the generator’s preliminary training stage\nemploys contrastive learning to align the structured data with\nits unstructured document descriptions. In a further stage of\ngenerator training, the model acknowledges the critical role\nof entity semantics in the representation learning of textual\ndata for retrieval, as highlighted by [Sciavolino et al., 2021,\nZhang et al., 2019]. This process commences with the identi-\nfication of entities within the structured data, followed by the\napplication of masks over these entities within the generator’s\ninput data, thus setting the stage for the model to anticipate\nand predict these masked elements.\n\nThe training regimen progresses with the model learning\nto reconstruct the masked entities by leveraging contextual\ninformation. This exercise cultivates the model’s comprehen-\nsion of the textual data’s structural semantics and facilitates\nthe alignment of pertinent entities within the structured data.\nThe overarching optimization goal is to train the language\nmodel to accurately restore the obscured spans, thereby en-\nriching its understanding of entity semantics [Ye et al., 2020].\n\n6 Augmentation in RAG\nThis section is structured around three key aspects: the aug-\nmentation stage, sources of augmentation data, and the aug-\nmentation process. These facets elucidate the critical tech-\nnologies pivotal to RAG’s development. A taxonomy of\nRAG’s core components is presented in Figure 4.\n\n6.1 RAG in Augmentation Stages\nRAG, a knowledge-intensive endeavor, incorporates a vari-\nety of technical methodologies across the pre-training, fine-\ntuning, and inference stages of language model training.\n\nPre-training Stage\nDuring the pre-training stage, researchers have investigated\nmethods to bolster PTMs for open-domain QA through\n\n\x0c']","The initial phase of training focuses on the retriever, where contrastive learning is used to refine the query and document embeddings.

What are the modules involved in Advanced RAG?,"['Figure 3: Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG\n\nis depicted in Figure 3. However, Modular RAG is not stan-\ndalone. Advanced RAG is a specialized form of modular\nRAG, and further, Naive RAG itself is a special case of Ad-\nvanced RAG. The relationship among the three paradigms is\none of inheritance and development.\n\nNew Modules\nSearch Module.\nIn contrast to the similarity retrieval in\nNaive/Advanced RAG, the Search Module is tailored to spe-\ncific scenarios and incorporates direct searches on additional\ncorpora. This integration is achieved using code generated\nby the LLM, query languages such as SQL or Cypher, and\nother custom tools. The data sources for these searches can\ninclude search engines, text data, tabular data, and knowledge\ngraphs [Wang et al., 2023d].\n\nMemory Module. This module harnesses the memory ca-\npabilities of the LLM to guide retrieval. The approach in-\nvolves identifying memories most similar to the current input.\nSelfmem [Cheng et al., 2023b] utilizes a retrieval-enhanced\ngenerator to create an unbounded memory pool iteratively,\ncombining the “original question” and “dual question”. By\nemploying a retrieval-enhanced generative model that uses its\nown outputs to improve itself, the text becomes more aligned\nwith the data distribution during the reasoning process. Con-\nsequently, the model’s own outputs are utilized instead of the\ntraining data [Wang et al., 2022a].\n\nFusion. RAG-Fusion [Raudaschl, 2023]enhances tradi-\ntional search systems by addressing their limitations through\na multi-query approach that expands user queries into mul-\n\ntiple, diverse perspectives using an LLM. This approach not\nonly captures the explicit information users seek but also un-\ncovers deeper, transformative knowledge. The fusion pro-\ncess involves parallel vector searches of both original and\nexpanded queries, intelligent re-ranking to optimize results,\nand pairing the best outcomes with new queries. This sophis-\nticated method ensures search results that align closely with\nboth the explicit and implicit intentions of the user, leading to\nmore insightful and relevant information discovery.\n\nRouting. The RAG system’s retrieval process utilizes di-\nverse sources, differing in domain, language, and format,\nwhich can be either alternated or merged based on the sit-\nuation [Li et al., 2023b]. Query routing decides the subse-\nquent action to a user’s query, with options ranging from\nsummarization, searching specific databases, or merging dif-\nferent pathways into a single response. The query router also\nchooses the appropriate data store for the query, which may\ninclude various sources like vector stores, graph databases, or\nrelational databases, or a hierarchy of indices—for instance, a\nsummary index and a document block vector index for multi-\ndocument storage. The query router’s decision-making is pre-\ndefined and executed via LLMs calls, which direct the query\nto the chosen index.\n\nPredict . It addresses the common issues of redundancy\nand noise in retrieved content. Instead of directly retrieving\nfrom a data source, this module utilizes the LLM to generate\nthe necessary context [Yu et al., 2022]. The content produced\nby the LLM is more likely to contain pertinent information\ncompared to that obtained through direct retrieval.\n\n\x0c']","The modules involved in Advanced RAG are Search Module, Memory Module, Fusion, Routing, and Predict.",simple,"[{'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '5'}]",True

RAG’s efficacy is limited by the context\nwindow size of Large Language Models (LLMs). Balancing\nthe trade-off between a window that is too short, risking insuf-\nficient information, and one that is too long, risking informa-\ntion dilution, is crucial. With ongoing efforts to expand LLM\ncontext windows to virtually unlimited sizes, the adaptation\nof RAG to these changes presents a significant research ques-\ntion [Xu et al., 2023c, Packer et al., 2023, Xiao et al., 2023].\nRobustness. The presence of noise or contradictory infor-\nmation during retrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s out-\n\nput quality. This situation is figuratively referred to as “Mis-\ninformation can be worse than no information at all”.\nIm-\nproving RAG’s resistance to such adversarial or counterfac-\ntual inputs is gaining research momentum and has become a\nkey performance metric [Yu et al., 2023a, Glass et al., 2021,\nBaek et al., 2023].\n\nHybrid Approaches (RAG+FT). Combining RAG with\nfine-tuning is emerging as a leading strategy. Determining the\noptimal integration of RAG and fine-tuning whether sequen-\ntial, alternating, or through end-to-end joint training—and\nhow to harness both parameterized and non-parameterized\nadvantages are areas ripe for exploration [Lin et al., 2023].\n\nExpanding LLM Roles. Beyond generating final answers,\nLLMs are leveraged for retrieval and evaluation within RAG\nframeworks. Identifying ways to further unlock LLMs poten-\ntial in RAG systems is a growing research direction.\n\nScaling Laws.

How does RAG enhance LLMs by integrating external knowledge bases?,"['perspectives. Additionally, we anticipate future direc-\ntions for RAG, emphasizing potential enhancements to\ntackle current challenges, expansions into multi-modal\nsettings, and the development of its ecosystem.\n\nThe paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 and 3 define RAG\nand detail its developmental process. Section 4 through 6 ex-\nplore core components—Retrieval, “Generation” and “Aug-\nmentation”—highlighting diverse embedded technologies.\nSection 7 focuses on RAG’s evaluation system. Section 8\ncompare RAG with other LLM optimization methods and\nsuggest potential directions for its evolution. The paper con-\ncludes in Section 9.\n\n2 Definition\nThe definition of RAG can be summarized from its workflow.\nFigure 2 depicts a typical RAG application workflow. In this\nscenario, a user inquires ChatGPT about a recent high-profile\nevent (i.e., the abrupt dismissal and reinstatement of Ope-\nnAI’s CEO) which generated considerable public discourse.\nChatGPT as the most renowned and widely utilized LLM,\nconstrained by its pretraining data, lacks knowledge of re-\ncent events. RAG addresses this gap by retrieving up-to-date\ndocument excerpts from external knowledge bases. In this in-\nstance, it procures a selection of news articles pertinent to the\ninquiry. These articles, alongside the initial question, are then\namalgamated into an enriched prompt that enables ChatGPT\nto synthesize an informed response. This example illustrates\nthe RAG process, demonstrating its capability to enhance the\nmodel’s responses with real-time information retrieval.\n\nTechnologically, RAG has been enriched through various\ninnovative approaches addressing pivotal questions such as\n“what to retrieve” “when to retrieve” and “how to use the\nretrieved information”. For “what to retrieve” research has\nprogressed from simple token [Khandelwal et al., 2019] and\nentity retrieval [Nishikawa et al., 2022] to more complex\nstructures like chunks [Ram et al., 2023] and knowledge\ngraph [Kang et al., 2023], with studies focusing on the\nretrieval and the level of data structur-\ngranularity of\ning.\nCoarse granularity brings more information but\nwith lower precision. Retrieving structured text provides\nmore information while sacrificing efficiency. The ques-\ntion of “when to retrieve” has led to strategies ranging\nfrom single [Wang et al., 2023e, Shi et al., 2023] to adap-\ntive [Jiang et al., 2023b, Huang et al., 2023] and multiple\nretrieval [Izacard et al., 2022] methods. High frequency of\nretrieval brings more information and lower efficiency. As\nfor ”how to use” the retrieved data, integration techniques\nhave been developed across various levels of the model\n[Khattab et al., 2022],\narchitecture,\nintermediate\nlay-\ners [Liang et al., 2023]. Although the “intermediate” and\n“output layers” are more effective, there are problems with\nthe need for training and low efficiency.\n\nincluding the input\n[Borgeaud et al., 2022],\n\noutput\n\nand\n\nRAG is a paradigm that enhances LLMs by integrating ex-\nternal knowledge bases. It employs a synergistic approach,\ncombining information retrieval mechanisms and In-Context\nLearning (ICL) to bolster the LLM’s performance.\nIn this\nframework, a query initiated by a user prompts the retrieval of\n\npertinent information via search algorithms. This information\nis then woven into the LLM’s prompts, providing additional\ncontext for the generation process. RAG’s key advantage lies\nin its obviation of the need for retraining of LLMs for task-\nspecific applications. Developers can instead append an ex-\nternal knowledge repository, enriching the input and thereby\nrefining the model’s output precision. RAG has become one\nof the most popular architectures in LLMs’ systems, due to\nits high practicality and low barrier to entry, with many con-\nversational products being built almost entirely on RAG.\n\nThe RAG workflow comprises three key steps. First, the\ncorpus is partitioned into discrete chunks, upon which vec-\ntor indices are constructed utilizing an encoder model. Sec-\nond, RAG identifies and retrieves chunks based on their vec-\ntor similarity to the query and indexed chunks.

"How is similarity calculated in the retrieval stage of the Advanced RAG system, and what optimizations can be made to the embedding models?","['and post-retrieval strategies. To address the indexing chal-\nlenges experienced by Naive RAG, Advanced RAG has re-\nfined its indexing approach using techniques such as slid-\ning window, fine-grained segmentation, and metadata. It has\nalso introduced various methods to optimize the retrieval pro-\ncess [ILIN, 2023].\n\nPre-Retrieval Process\nOptimizing Data Indexing.The goal of optimizing data index-\ning is to enhance the quality of the content being indexed.\nThis involves five primary strategies: enhancing data gran-\nularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata, align-\nment optimization, and mixed retrieval.\n\nEnhancing data granularity aims to elevate text standard-\nization, consistency, factual accuracy, and rich context to im-\nprove the RAG system’s performance. This includes remov-\ning irrelevant information, dispelling ambiguity in entities\nand terms, confirming factual accuracy, maintaining context,\nand updating outdated documents.\n\nOptimizing index structures involves adjusting the size of\nchunks to capture relevant context, querying across multiple\nindex paths, and incorporating information from the graph\nstructure to capture relevant context by leveraging relation-\nships between nodes in a graph data index.\n\nAdding metadata information involves integrating refer-\nenced metadata, such as dates and purposes, into chunks for\nfiltering purposes, and incorporating metadata like chapters\nand subsections of references to improve retrieval efficiency.\nAlignment optimization addresses alignment issues and\ndisparities between documents by introducing “hypothetical\nquestions” [Li et al., 2023d] into documents to rectify align-\nment issues and differences.\n\nRetrieval\nDuring the retrieval stage, the primary focus is on identifying\nthe appropriate context by calculating the similarity between\nthe query and chunks. The embedding model is central to\nthis process. In the advanced RAG, there is potential for op-\ntimization of the embedding models.\n\nFine-tuning Embedding. Fine-tuning embedding models\nsignificantly impact the relevance of retrieved content in RAG\nsystems. This process involves customizing embedding mod-\nels to enhance retrieval relevance in domain-specific contexts,\nespecially for professional domains dealing with evolving or\nrare terms. The BGE embedding model [BAAI, 2023], such\nas BGE-large-EN developed by BAAI2, is an example of a\nhigh-performance embedding model that can be fine-tuned\nto optimize retrieval relevance. Training data for fine-tuning\ncan be generated using language models like GPT-3.5-turbo\nto formulate questions grounded on document chunks, which\nare then used as fine-tuning pairs.\n\nDynamic Embedding adapts to the context in which words\nare used, unlike static embedding, which uses a single vec-\ntor for each word [Karpukhin et al., 2020]. For example,\nin transformer models like BERT, the same word can have\nvaried embeddings depending on surrounding words. Ope-\nnAI’s embeddings-ada-02 model3, built upon the principles\n\n2https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\n\nof LLMs like GPT, is a sophisticated dynamic embedding\nmodel that captures contextual understanding. However, it\nmay not exhibit the same sensitivity to context as the latest\nfull-size language models like GPT-4.\n\nPost-Retrieval Process\nAfter retrieving valuable context from the database, it is es-\nsential to merge it with the query as an input into LLMs while\naddressing challenges posed by context window limits. Sim-\nply presenting all relevant documents to the LLM at once may\nexceed the context window limit, introduce noise, and hinder\nthe focus on crucial information. Additional processing of the\nretrieved content is necessary to address these issues.\n\nRe-Ranking. Re-ranking the retrieved information to re-\nlocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt\nis a key strategy.\nThis concept has been implemented\nin frameworks such as LlamaIndex4, LangChain5, and\nHayStack [Blagojevi, 2023]. For example, Diversity Ranker6\nprioritizes reordering based on document diversity, while\nLostInTheMiddleRanker alternates placing the best docu-\nment at the beginning and end of the context window. Ad-\nditionally, approaches like cohereAI rerank [Cohere, 2023],\nbge-rerank7, and LongLL']",The similarity between the query and chunks is calculated in the retrieval stage of the Advanced RAG system. Optimizations can be made to the embedding models by fine-tuning the embedding models to enhance retrieval relevance in domain-specific contexts and by using dynamic embedding models that adapt to the context in which words are used.,reasoning,"[{'source': '../documents/2312.10997.pdf', 'page': '4'}]",True

This expansion underscores RAG’s\nsignificant practical implications for AI deployment, attract-\ning interest from both academic and industrial sectors. The\ngrowing ecosystem of RAG is underscored by an increase in\nRAG-centric AI applications and the ongoing development\nof supportive tools. However, as RAG’s application land-\nscape expands, there is an imperative need to refine evaluation\nmethodologies to keep pace with its evolution. Ensuring that\nperformance assessments remain accurate and representative\nis crucial for capturing the full extent of RAG’s contributions\nto the AI research and development community.\n\nReferences\n\n[Alon et al., 2022] Uri Alon, Frank Xu, Junxian He, Sudipta\nSengupta, Dan Roth, and Graham Neubig.\nNeuro-\nsymbolic language modeling with automaton-augmented\nretrieval.

"What are the stages and sources of augmentation used in training the language model, particularly in relation to contrastive learning and the use of structured and unstructured data?","['ulate both structural and\nsemantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on the retriever,\nwhere contrastive learning is harnessed to refine the query\nand document embeddings.\n\nSubsequently, the generator’s preliminary training stage\nemploys contrastive learning to align the structured data with\nits unstructured document descriptions. In a further stage of\ngenerator training, the model acknowledges the critical role\nof entity semantics in the representation learning of textual\ndata for retrieval, as highlighted by [Sciavolino et al., 2021,\nZhang et al., 2019]. This process commences with the identi-\nfication of entities within the structured data, followed by the\napplication of masks over these entities within the generator’s\ninput data, thus setting the stage for the model to anticipate\nand predict these masked elements.\n\nThe training regimen progresses with the model learning\nto reconstruct the masked entities by leveraging contextual\ninformation. This exercise cultivates the model’s comprehen-\nsion of the textual data’s structural semantics and facilitates\nthe alignment of pertinent entities within the structured data.\nThe overarching optimization goal is to train the language\nmodel to accurately restore the obscured spans, thereby en-\nriching its understanding of entity semantics [Ye et al., 2020].\n\n6 Augmentation in RAG\nThis section is structured around three key aspects: the aug-\nmentation stage, sources of augmentation data, and the aug-\nmentation process. These facets elucidate the critical tech-\nnologies pivotal to RAG’s development.

What issue does RAG integration into LLMs address and what is it commonly called?,"[' relevance of the output.\nThe dynamic retrieval of information from knowledge bases\nduring the inference phase allows RAG to address issues such\nas the generation of factually incorrect content, commonly\nreferred to as “hallucinations.” The integration of RAG into\nLLMs has seen rapid adoption and has become a pivotal tech-\nnology in refining the capabilities of chatbots and rendering\nLLMs more viable for practical applications.\n\nThe evolutionary trajectory of RAG unfolds across four\ndistinctive phases, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nIn its in-\nception in 2017, aligned with the emergence of the Trans-\nformer architecture, the primary thrust was on assimilating\nadditional knowledge through Pre-Training Models (PTM)\nto augment language models. This epoch witnessed RAG’s\nfoundational efforts predominantly directed at optimizing\npre-training methodologies.\n\nFollowing this initial phase, a period of relative dormancy\nensued before the advent of chatGPT, during which there was\nminimal advancement in related research for RAG.
