6,What kind of problems are one of the main topics studied in computational complexity theory?,"  Computational complexity theory is a branch of theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty. Some of the main topics studied in computational complexity theory include:
Time complexity: This refers to the amount of time required to solve a computational problem. Time complexity is often measured in terms of the size of the input, and it is a fundamental concept in computational complexity theory.
Space complexity: This refers to the amount of memory required to solve a computational problem. Space complexity is also measured in terms of the size of the input, and it is closely related to time complexity.
Practical limits of computation: Computational complexity theory aims to determine the practical limits of computation, i.e., what problems can be solved efficiently and what problems are inherently difficult to solve.
Hierarchy theorems: These are mathematical theorems that describe the relationship between different classes of computational problems in terms of their time and space complexity. The most well-known hierarchy theorems are the P vs. NP problem and the P vs. ZP problem.
Polynomial-time algorithms: These are algorithms that have a running time that is a polynomial function of the size of the input.

Time complexity: This refers to the amount of time required to solve a computational problem. Time complexity is often measured in terms of the size of the input, and it is a fundamental concept in computational complexity theory.
Space complexity: This refers to the amount of memory required to solve a computational problem. Space complexity is also measured in terms of the size of the input, and it is closely related to time complexity.
Practical limits of computation: Computational complexity theory aims to determine the practical limits of computation, i.e., what problems can be solved efficiently and what problems are inherently difficult to solve.
Hierarchy theorems: These are mathematical theorems that describe the relationship between different classes of computational problems in terms of their time and space complexity. The most well-known hierarchy theorems are the P vs. NP problem and the P vs. ZP problem.
Polynomial-time algorithms: These are algorithms that have a running time that is a polynomial function of the size of the input.
