What are the three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework?,"['Figure 7: Summary of RAG ecosystem\n\n9 Conclusion\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 7, high-\nlights RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the ca-\npabilities of LLMs through the integration of parameter-\nized knowledge from language models with extensive non-\nparameterized data from external knowledge bases. Our sur-\nvey illustrates the evolution of RAG technologies and their\nimpact on knowledge-intensive tasks.

What are the two key components of RAG models that are evaluated in terms of retrieval and generation quality?,"['Hoshi et al., 2023].\nDespite this, there is a notable paucity of research dedicated\nto evaluating the distinct characteristics of RAG models, with\nonly a handful of related studies.\n\n[Lewis et al., 2020,\n\nThe following section shifts the focus from task-specific\nevaluation methods and metrics to provide a synthesis of the\nexisting literature based on their unique attributes. This ex-\nploration covers the objectives of RAG evaluation, the aspects\nalong which these models are assessed, and the benchmarks\nand tools available for such evaluations. The aim is to offer a\ncomprehensive overview of RAG model evaluation, outlining\nthe methodologies that specifically address the unique aspects\nof these advanced generative systems.\n\n7.1 Evaluation Targets\nThe assessment of RAG models mainly revolves around two\nkey components: the retrieval and generation modules. This\ndivision ensures a thorough evaluation of both the quality of\ncontext provided and the quality of content produced.\n\nRetrieval Quality\nEvaluating the retrieval quality is crucial for determining the\neffectiveness of the context sourced by the retriever com-\nponent. Standard metrics from the domains of search en-\ngines, recommendation systems, and information retrieval\nsystems are employed to measure the performance of the\nRAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [Liu, 2023,\nNguyen, 2023].\n\nGeneration Quality\nThe assessment of generation quality centers on the gener-\nator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and relevant answers\nfrom the retrieved context. This evaluation can be catego-\nrized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled and la-\nbeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation encom-\npasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness of the\ngenerated answers.

What is the purpose of the Search Module in the RAG system?,"['Figure 3: Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG\n\nis depicted in Figure 3. However, Modular RAG is not stan-\ndalone. Advanced RAG is a specialized form of modular\nRAG, and further, Naive RAG itself is a special case of Ad-\nvanced RAG. The relationship among the three paradigms is\none of inheritance and development.\n\nNew Modules\nSearch Module.\nIn contrast to the similarity retrieval in\nNaive/Advanced RAG, the Search Module is tailored to spe-\ncific scenarios and incorporates direct searches on additional\ncorpora. This integration is achieved using code generated\nby the LLM, query languages such as SQL or Cypher, and\nother custom tools. The data sources for these searches can\ninclude search engines, text data, tabular data, and knowledge\ngraphs [Wang et al., 2023d].\n\nMemory Module. This module harnesses the memory ca-\npabilities of the LLM to guide retrieval. The approach in-\nvolves identifying memories most similar to the current input.\nSelfmem [Cheng et al., 2023b] utilizes a retrieval-enhanced\ngenerator to create an unbounded memory pool iteratively,\ncombining the “original question” and “dual question”. By\nemploying a retrieval-enhanced generative model that uses its\nown outputs to improve itself, the text becomes more aligned\nwith the data distribution during the reasoning process. Con-\nsequently, the model’s own outputs are utilized instead of the\ntraining data [Wang et al., 2022a].\n\nFusion. RAG-Fusion [Raudaschl, 2023]enhances tradi-\ntional search systems by addressing their limitations through\na multi-query approach that expands user queries into mul-\n\ntiple, diverse perspectives using an LLM. This approach not\nonly captures the explicit information users seek but also un-\ncovers deeper, transformative knowledge. The fusion pro-\ncess involves parallel vector searches of both original and\nexpanded queries, intelligent re-ranking to optimize results,\nand pairing the best outcomes with new queries. This sophis-\nticated method ensures search results that align closely with\nboth the explicit and implicit intentions of the user, leading to\nmore insightful and relevant information discovery.\n\nRouting. The RAG system’s retrieval process utilizes di-\nverse sources, differing in domain, language, and format,\nwhich can be either alternated or merged based on the sit-\nuation [Li et al., 2023b]. Query routing decides the subse-\nquent action to a user’s query, with options ranging from\nsummarization, searching specific databases, or merging dif-\nferent pathways into a single response. The query router also\nchooses the appropriate data store for the query, which may\ninclude various sources like vector stores, graph databases, or\nrelational databases, or a hierarchy of indices—for instance, a\nsummary index and a document block vector index for multi-\ndocument storage. The query router’s decision-making is pre-\ndefined and executed via LLMs calls, which direct the query\nto the chosen index.\n\nPredict . It addresses the common issues of redundancy\nand noise in retrieved content. Instead of directly retrieving\nfrom a data source, this module utilizes the LLM to generate\nthe necessary context [Yu et al., 2022]. The content produced\nby the LLM is more likely to contain pertinent information\ncompared to that obtained through direct retrieval.\n\n\x0c']","The purpose of the Search Module in the RAG system is to incorporate direct searches on additional corpora tailored to specific scenarios.

In this approach, the retriever mod-\nule is directly substituted to generate relevant documents ac-\ncording to a query. This method assists in addressing the dif-\nficulties encountered during the fine-tuning process and en-\nhances model performance.\n\n5 Generation\nA crucial component of RAG is its generator, which is re-\nsponsible for converting retrieved information into coherent\nand fluent text. Unlike traditional language models, RAG’s\ngenerator sets itself apart by improving accuracy and rele-\nvance via the incorporation of retrieved data. In RAG, the\ngenerator’s input encompasses not only typical contextual in-\nformation but also relevant text segments obtained through\nthe retriever. This comprehensive input enables the generator\nto gain a deep understanding of the question’s context, result-\ning in more informative and contextually relevant responses.\nFurthermore, the generator is guided by the retrieved text to\nensure coherence between the generated content and the ob-\ntained information. The diverse input data has led to targeted\nefforts during the generation phase, all aimed at refining the\nadaptation of the large model to the input data derived from\nqueries and documents. In the following subsections, we will\nexplore the introduction of the generator by delving into as-\npects of post-retrieval processing and fine-tuning.\n\n5.1 Post-retrieval with Frozen LLM\nIn the realm of untunable LLMs , many studies rely on well-\nestablished models like GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023] to harness\ntheir comprehensive internal knowledge for systematically\nsynthesizing retrieved information from various documents.\n\nHowever, challenges persist with these large models, includ-\ning limitations on context length and susceptibility to redun-\ndant information. To tackle these issues, certain research en-\ndeavors have turned their focus to post-retrieval processing.\n\nPost-retrieval processing involves treating, filtering, or op-\ntimizing the relevant information retrieved by the retriever\nfrom a large document database. Its main goal is to enhance\nthe quality of retrieval results, aligning them more closely\nwith user needs or subsequent tasks. It can be viewed as a\nreprocessing of the documents obtained during the retrieval\nphase. Common operations in post-retrieval processing typi-\ncally include information compression and result reranking.\n\nInformation Compression\nThe retriever excels at retrieving relevant information from a\nvast knowledge base, but managing the substantial amount of\ninformation within retrieval documents is a challenge. Ongo-\ning research aims to extend the context length of large lan-\nguage models to tackle this issue. However, current large\nmodels still struggle with context limitations. Therefore,\nthere are scenarios where condensing information becomes\nnecessary. Information condensation is significant for reduc-\ning noise, addressing context length restrictions, and enhanc-\ning generation effects.\n\nPRCA tackled this issue by training an information ex-\ntractor [Yang et al., 2023b]. In the context extraction phase,\nwhen provided with an input text Sinput, it is capable of\nproducing an output sequence Cextracted that represents the\ncondensed context']","These approaches aim to improve the synergy between the retriever and the LLM, leading to enhanced retrieval performance and more accurate responses to user inquiries.

In generation, Naive RAG faces challenges of hallucination, irrelevant context, and potential toxicity or bias in the model's output.

RAG’s efficacy is limited by the context\nwindow size of Large Language Models (LLMs). Balancing\nthe trade-off between a window that is too short, risking insuf-\nficient information, and one that is too long, risking informa-\ntion dilution, is crucial. With ongoing efforts to expand LLM\ncontext windows to virtually unlimited sizes, the adaptation\nof RAG to these changes presents a significant research ques-\ntion [Xu et al., 2023c, Packer et al., 2023, Xiao et al., 2023].\nRobustness. The presence of noise or contradictory infor-\nmation during retrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s out-\n\nput quality. This situation is figuratively referred to as “Mis-\ninformation can be worse than no information at all”.\nIm-\nproving RAG’s resistance to such adversarial or counterfac-\ntual inputs is gaining research momentum and has become a\nkey performance metric [Yu et al., 2023a, Glass et al., 2021,\nBaek et al., 2023].\n\nHybrid Approaches (RAG+FT). Combining RAG with\nfine-tuning is emerging as a leading strategy. Determining the\noptimal integration of RAG and fine-tuning whether sequen-\ntial, alternating, or through end-to-end joint training—and\nhow to harness both parameterized and non-parameterized\nadvantages are areas ripe for exploration [Lin et al., 2023].\n\nExpanding LLM Roles. Beyond generating final answers,\nLLMs are leveraged for retrieval and evaluation within RAG\nframeworks. Identifying ways to further unlock LLMs poten-\ntial in RAG systems is a growing research direction.\n\nScaling Laws. While scaling laws [Kaplan et al., 2020] are\nestablished for LLMs, their applicability to RAG remains un-\n\n\x0c']","The challenges that RAG technology faces in terms of noise management and counterfactual recognition include the presence of noise or contradictory information during retrieval, which can detrimentally affect RAG's output quality.
